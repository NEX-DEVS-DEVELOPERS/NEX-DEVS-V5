      },
      {
        question: "How long does it take to complete a project?",
        answer: "Project timelines vary based on complexity, scope, and specific requirements. A simple website might take 2-3 weeks, while complex web applications can take 2-3 months or more. During our initial consultation, I'll provide a detailed timeline estimate based on your project's specific needs. I pride myself on delivering projects on schedule without compromising quality."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you work with clients internationally?",

      {
        question: "Do you offer e-commerce development?",
        answer: "Yes, I specialize in e-commerce development using platforms like Shopify, WooCommerce, and custom solutions.

      {
        question: "Can you help with SEO and making my site rank better?",

    pricing: [
      {
        question: "Why do your services cost what they do?",
        answer: "My pricing reflects the value, expertise, and quality of work delivered. Each project is an investment in professional design, development, and strategy that drives business results. The rates account for my specialized technical skills, years of experience, premium-quality code, thorough testing, and ongoing support.

      },
      {
        question: "Do you offer fixed-price quotes or hourly rates?",
        answer: "I offer both fixed-price quotes for well-defined projects and hourly rates for ongoing work or projects with evolving requirements. For most client projects, I prefer fixed-price agreements as they provide budget certainty and allow me to focus on quality rather than watching the clock. My pricing structure is transparent, with no hidden fees or surprises."
      },
      {
        question: "What factors affect the cost of my website?",
        answer: "Several factors influence project costs: complexity (number of pages, features, and functionality), design requirements (custom designs vs. modifications), technical requirements (integrations, e-commerce capability, custom functionality), content needs (copywriting, photography), timeline (rush projects may incur additional costs), and ongoing support requirements. During our consultation, I'll breakdown these factors as they relate to your specific project."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you offer discounts for non-profits or startups?",
        answer: "I occasionally offer special packages for non-profits and early-stage startups that align with my values. While I can't discount my standard rates significantly (as it would compromise the quality and attention each project receives), I can work with you to phase development to fit budgetary constraints or simplify certain aspects while maintaining core functionality and quality."

    payment: [
      {
        question: "What payment methods do you accept?",
        answer: "I accept various payment methods including credit/debit cards, PayPal, bank transfers, and cryptocurrency payments. For international clients, I can work with you to find the most convenient and cost-effective payment method. All payment details will be clearly outlined in our agreement."
      },
      {
        question: "What is your payment schedule?",
        answer: "For most projects, I require a 50% deposit before work begins, with the remaining 50% due upon project completion but before the final launch. For larger projects, I offer milestone-based payment schedules, typically divided into 3-4 payments linked to specific deliverables. This approach helps distribute costs throughout the project timeline while ensuring steady progress."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you offer payment plans?",
        answer: "Yes, for larger projects I offer flexible payment plans to help manage cash flow. These are typically structured around project milestones and deliverables. We can discuss payment plan options during our consultation to find an arrangement that works for your budget while ensuring project momentum."
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if I'm not satisfied with the work?",
        answer: "Your satisfaction is my priority. All projects include revision rounds as specified in our agreement. If aspects of the delivered work don't meet the agreed-upon requirements, I'll make the necessary revisions at no additional cost. I maintain clear communication throughout the project to ensure expectations are aligned, preventing major discrepancies in the final deliverable."
      }
    ],
    process: [
      {
        question: "What is your development process like?",
        answer: "My development process follows a proven methodology: 1) Discovery and planning (understanding your goals, audience, and requirements), 2) Design (creating wireframes and visual mockups), 3) Development (building the actual website or application), 4) Testing (ensuring everything works properly across devices and browsers), 5) Launch (deploying the site to your server), and 6) Support (providing training and ongoing maintenance). Throughout this process, I emphasize communication and collaboration."
      },
      {
        question: "What information do you need from me to start?",
        answer: "To begin effectively, I'll need: your business information, project goals and objectives, target audience details, brand guidelines (logos, colors, fonts), content (text, images, videos), technical requirements or preferences, examples of websites you like, and any existing website analytics if applicable. The more information provided, the more tailored the solution will be to your specific needs."
      },
      {
        question: "How involved will I need to be during the project?",
        answer: "Your involvement is crucial at key stages: the initial briefing, feedback on designs and prototypes, content provision, and final review before launch. While I handle all technical aspects, your input ensures the end product aligns with your vision. I structure the process to respect your time while ensuring you have visibility and input at critical decision points."
      },
      {
        question: "What happens after my website launches?",
        answer: "After launch, I provide a handover that includes site training, documentation, and technical support to address any immediate issues. I offer various post-launch support options, from maintenance packages to development retainers, ensuring your site continues to perform optimally. I recommend regular maintenance and updates to keep your site secure, functioning well, and aligned with evolving web standards."
