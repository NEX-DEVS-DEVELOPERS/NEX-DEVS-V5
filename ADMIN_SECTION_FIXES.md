# Admin Section Fixes for Neon PostgreSQL Migration

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes made to the admin section of the portfolio application after migrating from MySQL to Neon PostgreSQL.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Project Edit Page
- Fixed the `handleSubmit` function in `app/admin/projects/edit/[id]/page.tsx` to properly handle project updates with Neon PostgreSQL
- Corrected the password handling to use the environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- Removed the project ID from the update data to prevent conflicts
- Fixed the authorization header to use the correct password

### 2. API Route for Project Updates
- Updated `app/api/projects/[id]/route.ts` to correctly handle the password in the request body
- Added logging to track the update process
- Standardized the password variable to use `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD` for consistency

### 3. Neon Database Module
- Enhanced `lib/neon.ts` to properly handle partial updates in the `updateProject` function
- Added a step to fetch the existing project data before applying updates
- Implemented proper merging of existing and new data to prevent data loss
- Added operation logging for better debugging
- Fixed the handling of JSON fields to ensure compatibility with PostgreSQL

### 4. Project Details Page
- Updated `app/projects/[id]/page.tsx` to use the dedicated API endpoint for fetching a single project
- Improved error handling and response processing
- Added better cache control to ensure fresh data

## Testing
- Created test scripts in `scripts/test-api.mjs` to verify API functionality
- Verified that the debug API endpoint correctly shows information from both MySQL and Neon databases
- Confirmed that project images are correctly linked and accessible

## Next Steps
- Continue monitoring the admin section for any issues
- Consider adding more comprehensive error handling
- Implement additional logging for better debugging
- Add unit tests to ensure continued functionality

## Environment Variables
Make sure these environment variables are properly set:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Used for authentication in the admin section
- `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for Neon PostgreSQL

## Conclusion
The admin section now properly works with Neon PostgreSQL, allowing project creation, editing, and deletion. The migration from MySQL to Neon PostgreSQL is complete, and all functionality has been preserved.
