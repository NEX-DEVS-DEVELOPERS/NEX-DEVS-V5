# Color Shift Fixes

This document outlines the changes made to fix color shift issues in the website, particularly with the navbar and overall layout.

## Problem
The website was experiencing significant color shifts during scrolling and page transitions, particularly affecting the navbar and the entire website's appearance.

## Solution Overview
The solution focused on creating consistent color variables and enforcing their usage across components with specific CSS rules.

## Changes Made

### 1. Color Variables System (`styles/color-consistency.css`)
- Created a dedicated CSS file to define and enforce consistent colors across the site
- Established CSS variables for background, navbar, text, and brand colors
- Added global overrides for HTML elements to use these variables

### 2. Navbar Component (`components/layout/Navbar.tsx`)
- Simplified animation properties to prevent color flashing
- Replaced hardcoded background colors with CSS variables
- Used more gradual transitions for color/backdrop changes
- Removed unnecessary inline styles that were causing conflicts
- Standardized transition effects for consistent appearance

### 3. Layout Consistency (`app/layout.tsx`)
- Added color variables to the root level for global access
- Created consistent navbar styling with proper background colors
- Ensured transitions between states are smooth and consistent
- Imported the dedicated color-consistency.css file

### 4. Client Layout (`app/components/ClientLayout.tsx`)
- Added explicit background color to the main content area
- Ensured consistent text colors match the design system
- Prevented background color inheritance issues

### 5. Barba.js Transitions (`styles/barba-transitions.css`)
- Fixed background colors during page transitions
- Added background color to transition containers
- Ensured the transition overlay has consistent color
- Added rules to maintain color consistency during animations

## Technical Implementation Details

### Color Variable System
```css
:root {
  --nex-dark-bg: #050509;
  --nex-darker-bg: #010102;
  --nex-navbar-bg: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9);
  --nex-navbar-scrolled-bg: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.95);
  --nex-navbar-border: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  --nex-navbar-scrolled-border: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
}
```

### Navbar Background Fix
```css
.navbar {
  background-color: var(--nex-navbar-bg) !important;
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
}

.navbar-inner {
  background-color: transparent !important;
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px) !important;
  border-color: var(--nex-navbar-border) !important;
}
```

### Page Container Background Fix
```css
main,
[data-page-content="true"],
[data-barba="container"],
.barba-container {
  background-color: var(--nex-dark-bg);
}
```

## Results
- Consistent dark background throughout the website
- Smooth navbar transitions without color flashing
- Consistent text colors across all components
- No more color shifts during scrolling or page transitions
- Maintained floating elements and sticky navbar functionality
