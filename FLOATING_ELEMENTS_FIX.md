# Floating and Sticky Element Fixes

This document outlines the changes made to fix floating and sticky UI elements in the Next.js application.

## Problem

Floating UI elements (like chatbots, fixed buttons) and sticky elements (like navbar) were not working correctly due to:
- Restrictive container styles
- `overflow: hidden` on parent elements
- Position conflicts
- GSAP-related scroll locks

## Changes Made

### 1. Layout Fixes (`app/layout.tsx`)

- Removed `position: relative`, `height: 100vh`, and `overflow: hidden` restrictions
- Used `min-height: 100vh` and allowed natural overflow
- Removed class `smooth-scroll optimized-element` from body
- Added proper CSS classes for fixed elements

### 2. Global CSS Fixes

In `app/globals.css`:
- Removed `overflow-x: hidden` from `body` and `html`
- Set `position: initial` on html/body elements
- Added `overflow-x: auto` and `overflow-y: auto` to allow proper scrolling
- Fixed the chatbot wrapper positioning with `position: fixed !important`
- Added utility classes for fixed positioning

In `styles/globals.css`:
- Removed references to GSAP for animations
- Implemented proper animation keyframes
- Fixed body/html scroll behavior
- Added `fixed-position` helper classes

### 3. Barba.js Transitions Fix (`styles/barba-transitions.css`)

- Prevented scroll-lock during page transitions
- Removed `overflow: hidden` from `.barba-prevent-scroll`
- Added proper fixed element classes for overlays

### 4. Portal Implementation

Created a new React Portal component (`FloatingPortal.tsx`):
- Uses `ReactDOM.createPortal` to render elements directly to `document.body`
- Ensures floating elements aren't affected by parent container styles

### 5. Client Layout Improvements

Updated `ClientLayout.tsx`:
- Removed restrictive styles like `gpu-accelerated`, `overflow-visible`, and `contain: paint style`
- Used the new FloatingPortal for the chatbot component

### 6. Chatbot Wrapper Update

Modified `ChatbotClientWrapper.tsx`:
- Used the `fixed-bottom-right` class to ensure proper positioning
- Added a specific ID for targeted styling

## Results

These changes ensure:
- All sticky elements (navbar, etc.) properly stick when scrolling
- Floating UI elements (chatbot, buttons) stay fixed in their positions
- Page scrolling works correctly without restrictions
- Next.js dev overlay remains floating in dev mode
- No overflow is hidden unless explicitly required

## Testing

To verify the changes:
1. Ensure the chatbot stays fixed when scrolling
2. Verify the navbar correctly sticks when scrolling
3. Confirm horizontal scrolling works when content is wider than viewport
4. Check that floating buttons remain visible during page transitions
