# Database Migration Summary: MySQL to Neon PostgreSQL

## Migration Overview

This document summarizes the migration of project data from the original MySQL database (hosted on Railway) to the new Neon PostgreSQL database.

## Completed Tasks

1. **Database Setup**
   - Created and configured a Neon PostgreSQL database
   - Established connectivity from the application to the Neon database
   - Created the necessary table structure in PostgreSQL to match the MySQL schema

2. **Data Migration**
   - Successfully imported 11 projects from the original `projects.json` file
   - Verified all project data fields were correctly transferred
   - Ensured all project images are correctly maintained and linked
   - Created placeholders for any missing images (2 projects required this)

3. **Application Updates**
   - Updated the database module to use Neon PostgreSQL
   - Fixed SQL query syntax to be compatible with PostgreSQL
   - Created debug endpoints to verify database connectivity
   - Updated API routes to use the new database

## Test Results

The following tests were conducted to verify the migration:

1. **Database Connectivity Test**
   - Successfully connected to Neon PostgreSQL
   - Executed test queries to verify data integrity

2. **Project Count Verification**
   - Total projects: 11
   - Featured projects: 9
   - Project categories: UI/UX Design, Web Development, Web Development with AI Integration

3. **Image Verification**
   - All 11 primary project images verified
   - 1 secondary project image verified
   - Created placeholders for 2 missing images

## Next Steps

- Monitor the application performance with the new database
- Consider cleaning up unused Railway MySQL tables and resources
- Update application documentation to reflect the new database architecture

## Backup Information

Backup files were created during the migration process:
- Original `projects.json` backup in the `backups` directory
- Script to reimport data if needed in `scripts/import-projects-from-json.js`

## Technical Details

- **Database Type**: Neon PostgreSQL (Serverless)
- **Connection Method**: `@neondatabase/serverless` package
- **Data Types**: PostgreSQL JSONB for structured data (technologies, features, etc.)
- **Images Storage**: Maintained in the public directory, paths stored in the database
